<h1>MY BEAUTIFUL DARK TWISTED FANTASY</h1>
<p class="textone">THEY WERE SUCKERS.<br/><br/>THEY HAD NO BALLS. AN INDIVIDUAL COMMITS A CRIME IF HE OR SHE ACTS IN A WAY THAT FULFILLS EVERY ELEMENT OF AN OFFENSE. TO US, THOSE GOODY-GOOD PEOPLE WHO WORKED SHITTY JOBS FOR BUM PAYCHECKS, WHO TOOK THE SUBWAY TO WORK EVERY DAY AND WORRIED ABOUT THEIR BILLS, WERE DEAD. INVISIBLY SET, FACELESS. I'M JUST YOUNG, RICH, AND TASTELESS. FUCK YOU, PAY ME. YOU HAD A FIRE? FUCK YOU, PAY MA. THE PLACE GOT HIT BY LIGHTING? FUCK YOU, PAY ME.<br/><br/>IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD EVER SEEN ANYONE SHOT. IT WAS A GLORIOUS TIME. IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST UNIVERSAL ANTIDOTES OF THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE WE HAVE THAT COMBATS MISERY AND SUSTAINS HOPE.<br/><br/>GUYS WOULD GET INTO ARGUMENTS OVER NOTHING AND BEFORE YOU KNEW IT, ONE OF THEM WAS DEAD. VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER IS INTENTIONALLY KILLING ANOTHER PERSON IN THE HEAT OF PASSION AND IN RESPONSE TO ADEQUATE PROVOCATION.<br/><br/>THEY WERE SHOOTING EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME, SOLICITS EXTRACTION OF BEAUTY FROM THE UGLY, A PREREQUISITION OF TELOS IN DRUGS, PROSTITUTION, DEATH, POVERTY, ABSENCE OF EDUCATION AND FAULTY UPBRINGING. SHOOTING PEOPLE WAS A NORMAL THING.</p>
<p class="texttwo">WE TOOK A WALK WITH THE BASTARDS OF MARQUIS DE SADE, FREE-FOR ALL OF VIOLENCE, PORN, HORROR, GANGSTER PROCLIVITIES, AND REVISITED MEMOIRS FROM PIMPS, PROSTITUTES AND INTELLECTUALS. FOR US TO LIVE ANY OTHER WAY WAS NUTS.<br/><br/>FOR MOST OF THE GUYS, KILLING GOT TO BE ACCEPTED. THEY WERE ROUTINE. MURDER WAS THE ONLY WAY EVERYBODY STAYED IN LINE. IT WAS THE ULTIMATE WEAPON. YON GOT OUT OF LINE, YOU GOT WHACKED. EVERYONE KNEW THE RULES. I TOLD KANYE, ‘LISTEN MAN WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE CCA AND THE DEA, THEY’RE WATCHING, THEY’RE WATCHING US.<br/><br/>WILLFULLY AND MALICIOUSLY SET FIRE TO ANY BUILDING, STRUCTURE. HITS NEVER BOTHERED HIM. IT WAS BUSINESS. THE KIND OF GUY WHO ROOTED FOR THE BAD GUYS IN THE MOVIES.<br/><br/>HE WAS FIRST LOCKED UP AT ELEVEN AND WAS DOING HITS FOR MOB BOSSES WHEN HE WAS SIXTEEN.<br/><br/>RELAX. HE'S DRUNK. HE'S BEEN LOCKED UP FOR SIX YEARS.<br/><br/>HIS WORLDWIDE VIEW CAN BE SEEN THROUGH THE KENS OF A PICARESQUE NOVEL WHERE THE READER ENCOUNTERS A ROGUE CHARACTER THAT USES HIS WIT TO OVERCOME FOLLIES IN A WORLD THAT’S ALWAYS UNDERMINING HIM. HIS PUBLIC AND PROFESSIONAL IMAGE SOMETIMES AT WAR WITH HIS OWN HIGHLY</p>
